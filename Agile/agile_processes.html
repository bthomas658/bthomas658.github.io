<h1>Agile Processes</h1>
<hr />
<h2>History of Agile Processes:</h2>
<p>Software engineering has dated back to the 1960's, but since then software engineer professionals have been improving the process by introducing new software development lifecycles. As students, the waterfall model and iterative waterfall model are the most common development lifecycles that you learn. The types of development lifecycles that are taught to students are heavyweight models that require a lot of documentation. There has recently been a push for lightweight development models. This is where the Agile Manifesto and the Agile Alliance were born.</p>
<p>The Agile Manifesto states a number of ideologies for  developing software. There are four values in which the manifesto suggests are important:</p>
<p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools <br />
  <strong>Working software </strong>over comprehensive documentation <br />
  <strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation <br />
  <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan </p>
<p>In addition to these four values, there are twelve principles that agile methodologies must follow:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
    through early and continuous delivery
    of valuable software. </li>
  <li> Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
    development. Agile processes harness change for 
    the customer's competitive advantage. </li>
  <li> Deliver working software frequently, from a 
    couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
    preference to the shorter timescale. </li>
  <li> Business people and developers must work 
    together daily throughout the project. </li>
  <li> Build projects around motivated individuals. 
    Give them the environment and support they need, 
    and trust them to get the job done. </li>
  <li> The most efficient and effective method of 
    conveying information to and within a development 
    team is face-to-face conversation. </li>
  <li> Working software is the primary measure of progress. </li>
  <li> Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. </li>
  <li> Continuous attention to technical excellence 
    and good design enhances agility. </li>
  <li> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
    of work not done--is essential. </li>
  <li> The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
    emerge from self-organizing teams. </li>
  <li> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
    its behavior accordingly. </li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, there are important ideologies and principles. Working in short development cycles, creating quality software often, and improving team productivity are all important to an agile model of software development. </p>
<h2>So what does this mean?</h2>
<p>There is no single model that is agile. There are more models that fall under this category, so it is important to research the models and pick the best model for you. The model you choose may be a heavyweight model, but could also be an agile model. </p>
<p>There are a number of popular agile models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SCRUM</li>
  <li>Extreme Programming</li>
  <li>Test Driven Development (TDD)</li>
  <li>Feature Driven Development</li>
  <li>WebHelix</li>
</ul>
<p>SCRUM and Extreme Programming will be explored in greater detail. The others will be mentioned as examples of agile models. </p>
