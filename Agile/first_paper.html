<h1>Agile Processes Paper </h1>
<hr />
<p>Design a proposal (2-5 pages) to incorporate agile processes into new development of a web-based application (the project that will be completed in the second half is a good example of a project). The project has not been started yet and no requirements have been gathered. All that is known is that the project needs to be completed. The proposal, which is directed toward a supervisor, project owner, or major stakeholder should contain the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the process that you want to implement?</li>
  <li>Why do you want to use this process?</li>
  <li>How will the development of the project progress?
    <ul>
      <li>How will requirements be gathered?</li>
      <li>How long will the iterations be?</li>
      <li>How is it decided what is completed during an iteration?</li>
      <li>When is an iteration complete?</li>
      <li>When is an iteration considered a success?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the benefits for using this process to the project?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have been exposed to a few different agile processes (SCRUM, Extreme Programming, TDD, Web Helix)</li>
  <li>There is no standard agile process--you may come up with your own as long as you outline the process and provide an argument</li>
  <li>You will need to research whatever process (or design your own process) more in depth than what has been provided in class    </li>
</ul>
